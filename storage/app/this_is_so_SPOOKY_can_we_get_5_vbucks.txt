<article><h2>Spooky skeleton VR</h2><div class="artcontent"><div class="contentvid"><img src="http://localhost/bidoofgoo.nl/img/projects/skele.png"></div>Spooky skeleton VR is a small Virtual Reality experience that's made as practice. I'm not saying it's a good experience that's worth sharing, but it's an amazing experience that you really should share if you don't want to anger the skeleton lords. You can experience Spoopy skelotin in VR by placing your phone in a google cardboard (or any other vr device) and clicking on the vr button on the bottom right of the screen. You can also open the app on your phone without VR, but the skeleton lords might not like it. Enter at your own risk of getting 2 spooked.<br><br><div class="button" onclick="openNewTab('https://bidoofgoo.nl/oud/')">Open vr experience</div><br></article>
