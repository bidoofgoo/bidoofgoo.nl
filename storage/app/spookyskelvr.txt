<article><h2>Spooky skeleton VR</h2><div class="artcontent"><div class="contentvid"><img src="http://localhost/bidoofgoo.nl/img/projects/skele.png"></div>Spooky skeleton VR is a small Virtual Reality experience that's made as practice. I'm not saying it's a good experience that's worth sharing, but it's an amazing experience that you really should share if you don't want to anger the skeleton lords. You can experience Spoopy skelotin Veear by placing your phone in a google cardboard (or any other vr device) and clicking on the vr button on the bottom right of the screen.<br><br><div class="button" onclick="openNewTab('https://bidoofgoo.nl/oud/')">Open vr experience</div><br></article>
