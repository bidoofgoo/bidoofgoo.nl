<article><h2>Why we hate you</h2><div class="artcontent">Why we hate you is a short animation series that can be found on Youtube.com. At the time "Why we hate you" came to be, I was in a group called Gaming4LifeXD (or G4l for short (also yes I realize how stupid that name is)). G4l focused on playing video games for a live audience on Twitch.tv. We would play video games to fundraise money for charity. The group consisted out of a couple of people and we would take shifts in the streaming. One day one of the crew members had trouble with his personal computer for a while, so he couldn't stream on his assigned days and others had to fill in for him. It had become a gag for us to nag about it. One day I grabbed one of my friends, opened a google documents file and made an animation about it.<div class="contentvid"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEmf__ZTKuk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>A while later, when we were still streaming, our good friend had gone on vacation, so he couldn't stream for a while. I was looking over at my friend and we were both struck with inspiration. LET'S NAG ABOUT THIS TOO! This time, in a team of 3, we started a google documents file and wrote the most bestest thing ever.<div class="contentvid"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kCB5kcoRNtE?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>Of course our streaming shenanigans are long over, but I surely look back to it with a smile.</div></article>
