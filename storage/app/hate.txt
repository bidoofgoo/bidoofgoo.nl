<article><h2>Why we hate you</h2><div class="artcontent">Why we hate you is a short animation series that can be found on Youtube.com. At the time "Why we hate you" came to be, I was in a group called Gaming4LifeXD (or G4l for short). G4l focused on playing video games for a live audience on Twitch.tv. We would play video games to fundraise money for charity. The group consisted out of a couple of people and we would take shifts in the streaming. One day one of the crew members had trouble with his Pc for a while, so he couldn't stream on his assigned days and others had to fill in.<div class="contentimg"></div></div></article>
